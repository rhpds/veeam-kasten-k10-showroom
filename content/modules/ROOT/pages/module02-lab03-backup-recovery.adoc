. Click on the most recent snapshot's hamburger menu and select *_Restore_*
+
====
[IMPORTANT]
 There are two options from which to restore. The top-most is the exported backup which is stored on our S3 object storage and the second top-most is local snapshot. In the event of an accidental deletion, restoring from local cluster backup is sufficient, but if we were facing the result of a ransomware attack we would likely want to restore from the S3 bucket. For the purposes of this lab, we’ll just the local cluster backup since restore time will be slightly faster
====
. Scroll down and click *Deselect All Artifacts* then click the tick box next to the _pacman-mongodb_ item under the _Snapshot (1)_ section

== 4. Takeaways

* Kasten automatically interrogates and detects namespaces on the cluster
* Backup jobs are configured on a per-namespace basis and can be configured quickly
* We can easily monitor actions via the Kasten UI
* We have granular control on how we restore from backup, including whether from on-cluster or exported storage
* We have granular control over which components we wish to recover and/or overwrite
